# Golf Parlay Picker - Filter System Enhancement PRD

## Project Overview
Enhance the existing golf parlay picker filter system by implementing and improving strategic player selection filters. The system currently has a well-architected filter framework with SG Heavy fully implemented, but needs additional sophisticated filters for comprehensive player analysis.

## Background
The current filter system includes:
- ✅ SG Heavy (fully implemented)
- ✅ Heavy Favorites (fully implemented) 
- ✅ SG Category Leaders (fully implemented)
- ⚠️ SG Value (basic implementation - needs enhancement)
- ⚠️ Balanced (basic implementation - needs enhancement)

## Goals
1. Enhance existing basic filter implementations with sophisticated algorithms
2. Implement new strategic filters leveraging existing data services
3. Maintain consistency with established filter architecture patterns
4. Provide comprehensive player selection strategies for different scenarios

## Success Criteria
- All filters follow the established FilterInterface pattern
- Filters integrate seamlessly with existing UI components
- Each filter provides meaningful player differentiation
- Filters leverage existing data services (SG stats, course DNA, player archetypes)
- Performance is optimized for real-time filtering

## Technical Requirements

### Priority 1: Enhanced Existing Filters

#### SG Value Filter Enhancement
- **Current State**: Basic implementation exists
- **Requirements**:
  - Calculate SG performance percentiles vs field
  - Compare performance to implied probability from betting odds  
  - Weight recent vs historical performance appropriately
  - Factor in course fit and conditions
  - Implement value score algorithm (performance exceeds market expectations)
  - Add configurable options for time periods and weighting factors

#### Balanced Filter Enhancement  
- **Current State**: Basic implementation exists
- **Requirements**:
  - Calculate percentile ranks across all SG categories (OTT, APP, ARG, PUTT)
  - Implement minimum threshold requirements (e.g., 40th percentile minimum)
  - Add bonus scoring for excellence (70th+ percentile categories)
  - Penalize severe weaknesses (below 20th percentile)
  - Create comprehensive balance scoring algorithm
  - Add configuration options for threshold adjustments

### Priority 2: New Strategic Filters

#### Player Archetype Filter
- **Requirements**:
  - Leverage existing player archetype classification system
  - Filter by playing styles: bombers, scramblers, putters, iron specialists
  - Integrate with existing archetype service
  - Provide clear archetype-based selection options
  - Support multiple archetype selection

#### Momentum Filter
- **Requirements**:
  - Track SG performance trends over configurable periods (4-8 rounds)
  - Implement recency weighting for recent rounds
  - Calculate momentum slopes and trend analysis
  - Factor in strength of field adjustments
  - Identify positive/negative momentum patterns
  - Return players with strongest momentum indicators

#### Course Fit Filter  
- **Requirements**:
  - Integrate with existing course DNA analysis system
  - Match player strengths to course characteristics
  - Analyze historical performance on similar course types
  - Factor in weather and course conditions
  - Calculate course fit scores based on multiple factors
  - Support course-specific optimization

### Priority 3: Advanced Analysis Filters

#### Form/Consistency Filter
- **Requirements**:
  - Analyze recent tournament results and performance patterns
  - Calculate consistency metrics using statistical measures
  - Implement trend analysis over configurable periods
  - Weight performance by field strength and course similarity
  - Provide form-based player rankings

#### Weather Filter
- **Requirements**:
  - Analyze historical performance under various weather conditions
  - Factor in forecasted weather for upcoming tournaments
  - Adjust SG statistics for weather impacts
  - Support weather-specific player optimization
  - Integrate with weather data sources

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Consistency
- All filters must implement the FilterInterface from /filters/types.ts
- Register filters in /filters/initFilters.ts using registerCoreFilters()
- Follow established naming conventions and file structure
- Maintain singleton FilterService pattern

### Data Integration
- Leverage existing services: SG stats, course DNA, player archetypes
- Ensure efficient data access and caching
- Minimize redundant data fetching
- Maintain data consistency across filters

### UI Integration  
- Filters should work seamlessly with existing FilterPanel component
- Support both compact and expanded configuration modes
- Provide clear tooltips and descriptions
- Add configuration options appropriate for each filter type

### Performance Requirements
- All filters must execute within 2 seconds for typical datasets
- Implement efficient algorithms with appropriate time complexity
- Cache expensive calculations where appropriate
- Optimize for real-time user interaction

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each filter implementation
- Integration tests with existing filter system
- Performance benchmarking for large datasets
- UI component testing for filter configurations

## Documentation
- Update filter documentation with new implementations
- Provide clear descriptions of each filter's purpose and algorithm
- Document configuration options and use cases
- Include examples of optimal filter combinations
