# Test Strategy:
1. Test CI/CD pipeline with test commits
2. Verify that tests run correctly in the CI environment
3. Test deployment to staging and production environments
4. Verify that test coverage reporting works correctly
5. Test bundle size monitoring
6. Verify that performance regression testing catches issues
7. Test rollback procedures for failed deployments
8. Verify that the deployment process is documented

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure GitHub Actions Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic GitHub Actions workflow configuration file to trigger on push and pull requests.
### Details:
Create a .github/workflows directory and add a main.yml file that defines the CI/CD pipeline triggers, environment, and basic structure. Include configuration for different branches (main/development) and event types.

## 2. Implement Automated Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Configure the CI pipeline to run automated tests for the codebase.
### Details:
Add test runners for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Configure the appropriate test frameworks, set up test environments, and ensure tests run on each push and pull request.

## 3. Set Up Code Coverage Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Implement code coverage analysis and reporting in the CI pipeline.
### Details:
Integrate a code coverage tool (like Jest, Istanbul, or Codecov), configure it to generate reports after test runs, and set up visualization of coverage metrics. Configure minimum coverage thresholds if needed.

## 4. Configure Build Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Set up the automated build process for creating deployable artifacts.
### Details:
Configure the build step to compile code, bundle assets, optimize for production, and create deployable packages. Include environment-specific configurations and versioning strategy.

## 5. Implement Deployment Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Configure automated deployment to staging and production environments.
### Details:
Set up deployment workflows for different environments, implement environment-specific configurations, add deployment approval gates if needed, and configure rollback mechanisms in case of failures.

## 6. Set Up Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.5
### Description: Implement performance monitoring and alerting for the deployed application.
### Details:
Integrate performance monitoring tools, configure metrics collection for application performance, set up dashboards for visualization, and implement alerting for performance degradation or errors in production.
