# Task ID: 18
# Title: Task #18: Refactor PlayerTable Component for Performance and Maintainability
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the PlayerTable and related components/hooks to eliminate performance issues, reduce re-renders, and improve overall maintainability while enhancing the user experience.
# Details:
## Objectives
- Eliminate infinite render loops and excessive React Query fetches
- Implement proper component architecture with separation of concerns
- Optimize React performance with appropriate memoization

## Implementation Details
1. **Data Fetching Layer**:
   - Create dedicated React Query hooks for player data fetching
   - Implement proper query keys and caching strategies
   - Add suspense boundaries for loading states
   - Use React Server Components where applicable for data fetching

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Separate the PlayerTable into smaller, focused components:
     - PlayerTableContainer (manages data fetching)
     - PlayerTablePresentation (pure presentation component)
     - PlayerTableFilters (handles filter UI and logic)
     - PlayerTablePagination (handles pagination)
   - Ensure each component has a single responsibility

3. **React Table Implementation**:
   - Use memoized column definitions (useCallback/useMemo)
   - Implement memoized data transformations
   - Optimize sorting and filtering functions
   - Follow React Table best practices for performance

4. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Implement clear loading states using Suspense or skeleton loaders
   - Add proper error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Improve table layout for better readability
   - Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Implement Shadcn UI and Radix UI components for consistent styling
   - Use Tailwind for custom styling needs

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Remove all console.log statements and debugging code
   - Ensure all hooks follow React's Rules of Hooks
   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - Follow project conventions for file structure
   - Implement proper TypeScript typing

6. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure proper ARIA attributes on table elements
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Test with screen readers
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast

7. **Documentation**:
   - Document the new component architecture
   - Create a migration guide for any breaking changes
   - Document any new patterns or conventions introduced

## Dependencies
- React Query for data fetching
- React Table for table implementation
- Shadcn UI and Radix UI for components
- Tailwind CSS for styling

# Test Strategy:
## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each individual component in isolation
   - Mock React Query hooks and data fetching
   - Verify proper rendering of loading, error, and success states
   - Test memoization effectiveness by monitoring render counts
   - Verify proper prop passing between components

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the complete PlayerTable with all subcomponents
   - Verify data flows correctly through the component hierarchy
   - Test sorting functionality with different column types
   - Test filtering with various filter combinations
   - Verify pagination works correctly

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Use React DevTools Profiler to measure render counts
   - Compare before/after render performance
   - Verify elimination of infinite loops using console logging
   - Test with large datasets (100+ rows) to ensure smooth performance
   - Measure and compare initial load time and interaction responsiveness

4. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Run automated accessibility tests (e.g., axe, lighthouse)
   - Perform manual keyboard navigation testing
   - Test with screen readers
   - Verify proper focus management

5. **Responsive Testing**:
   - Test on multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Verify table layout adapts appropriately
   - Test touch interactions on mobile devices

6. **User Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Table loads player data without infinite loops or excessive fetches
   - Sorting and filtering work correctly and efficiently
   - Loading states are clearly indicated
   - Error states provide helpful information
   - Table is responsive and accessible
   - Performance is noticeably improved from previous implementation
   - All project code conventions are followed

7. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Review migration guide for completeness
   - Verify component documentation matches implementation
   - Ensure new patterns are clearly explained

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Dedicated Data Fetching Layer with React Query [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a dedicated data fetching layer using React Query to eliminate excessive fetches and implement proper caching strategies.
### Details:
1. Create a `usePlayersQuery.ts` hook that encapsulates all player data fetching logic
2. Implement proper query keys for effective caching
3. Add suspense boundaries for loading states
4. Configure proper stale time and cache time settings
5. Implement error handling within the query hook
6. Add pagination, sorting, and filtering parameters to the query
7. Use React Query's built-in state management for loading/error states

## 2. Refactor PlayerTable into Smaller Component Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Break down the monolithic PlayerTable component into smaller, focused components with clear separation of concerns.
### Details:
