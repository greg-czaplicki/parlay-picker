# Task ID: 22
# Title: Task #22: Implement Custom Filtering System for Player/Matchup Data
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an extensible, type-safe filtering system that allows users to filter player and matchup data using predefined categories such as 'Balanced', 'SG Heavy', 'SG Value', and 'Heavy Favorites'.
# Details:
The implementation should include:

1. **Centralized Filter Module**:
   - Create a dedicated `/filters` directory to house all filter-related code
   - Implement a core `FilterService` class/module that manages filter registration and execution
   - Design a plugin architecture allowing new filters to be added without modifying existing code

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all filter-related entities:
     - `Filter` interface with properties like `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, and `applyFilter` method
     - `FilterResult` type to standardize filter output
     - `FilterOptions` interface for configurable filter parameters
   - Use discriminated unions for different filter types if needed
   - Implement proper type guards where necessary

3. **Filter Implementation**:
   - Create individual filter implementations for each required filter type:
     - 'Balanced': Players/matchups with balanced statistics
     - 'SG Heavy': Focus on shooting guard positions
     - 'SG Value': Value picks for shooting guards
     - 'Heavy Favorites': Teams/players strongly favored to win
   - Each filter should have its own file and export a factory function
   - Include documentation for each filter's logic and expected behavior

4. **UI Integration**:
   - Design filter selector components that integrate with the existing UI
   - Implement filter application feedback (loading states, result counts)
   - Create a filter management panel for enabling/disabling filters
   - Ensure responsive design for all filter UI components

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Implement memoization for filter results to prevent unnecessary recalculations
   - Consider pagination or virtualization for large filtered datasets
   - Add debouncing for filter changes to prevent excessive processing

6. **Documentation**:
   - Document the filter architecture and extension points
   - Include usage examples for implementing new filters
   - Create API documentation for the filter interfaces

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the filtering system:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each individual filter implementation with various input datasets
   - Verify correct behavior for edge cases (empty data, boundary conditions)
   - Test filter combinations to ensure they work together properly
   - Use Jest and testing-library for component tests

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the integration between the filter system and the data sources
   - Verify UI components correctly display filtered results
   - Test filter persistence across page refreshes if applicable

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Benchmark filter performance with large datasets
   - Verify memoization is working correctly by tracking execution counts

4. **Type Safety Tests**:
   - Use TypeScript's `expectType` or similar utilities to verify type correctness
   - Ensure the compiler catches incorrect filter implementations

5. **Manual Testing Checklist**:
   - Verify all filters produce expected results with real data
   - Test the UI for usability and responsiveness
   - Confirm filter state is correctly maintained during navigation
   - Check accessibility of all filter UI components

6. **Test Data**:
   - Create mock datasets that exercise all filter conditions
   - Include boundary cases and special conditions for each filter type

7. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Review generated API documentation for completeness
   - Verify example code in documentation works as expected

**Integration Status Update - Debugging Filtering System**

**Completed Integration Work:**
✅ Integrated filtering system into Dashboard component
✅ Filters now only apply to RecommendedPicks sidebar (not main matchups table)
✅ Simplified UI - removed redundant filter headings
✅ Filters show inline without modal popups
✅ Updated components to accept external filtered data

**Current Issue Being Debugged:**
❌ No results showing in RecommendedPicks even with simple "Heavy Favorites" filter

**Debug Steps Added:**
- Added comprehensive logging to `useRecommendedPicksQuery` to check base data
- Added detailed logging to Heavy Favorites filter to trace processing
- Added debug output in RecommendedPicks component to monitor data flow

**Key Architectural Changes Made:**
1. **Dashboard Component**: Now manages filtering state and passes filtered data to RecommendedPicks
2. **RecommendedPicks Component**: Accepts external filtered data or uses internal filtering  
3. **MatchupsTable Component**: Removed filtering integration (kept original behavior)
4. **FilterPanel**: Shows inline without modal when `compact={false}`

**Next Steps:**
1. Check browser console debug logs to identify data flow issue
2. Verify if base API data is being returned correctly
3. Check if odds format matches filter expectations (decimal vs American)
4. Fix any data/threshold mismatches found

**Current Filter Architecture:**
- Heavy Favorites: Should find players with ≥0.4 decimal odds gap (≥40 American odds points)
- Dashboard passes filter state to useFilteredPlayers hook
- Hook applies filters to base recommended picks data
- Filtered results passed to RecommendedPicks component

<info added on 2025-06-04T00:03:06.637Z>
**Fixed Heavy Favorites Filter Issue**

**Root Cause Identified:**
- All players had `matchupId: undefined` from API response  
- Filter was treating 138 players as one giant group instead of separate matchups
- Smallest odds gap in that huge group (0.108) was below 0.4 threshold

**Solution Implemented:**
✅ Updated Heavy Favorites filter with fallback grouping strategy
✅ Now detects when `matchupId` is undefined and creates artificial groups
✅ Groups every 3 consecutive players (for 3-ball matchups) 
✅ Applies odds gap logic within each small group, not entire field
✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to trace grouping logic

**Technical Details:**
- Filter checks `hasProperMatchupIds = (data ?? []).some((player: any) => player.matchupId != null)`
- If false, uses `playersWithOdds.slice(i, i + groupSize)` for grouping
- Each group now properly compared for 0.4 odds gap threshold
- Should now find heavy favorites within individual matchups

**Next Steps:**
- Test in browser console to see new debug output
- Verify filter now finds heavy favorites in small groups
- Monitor performance with artificial grouping strategy

**Status:** Filter logic fixed, ready for testing

<info added on 2025-06-04T00:04:30.856Z>
**ROOT CAUSE FIXED: Matchup ID Issue Resolved**

**Problem Identified:**
❌ API returns `uuid` field as identifier, but code was using `apiMatchup.id` (undefined)
❌ All players had `matchupId: undefined`, causing filter to treat 138 players as one giant group
❌ Heavy Favorites filter couldn't find proper odds gaps in huge group (0.108 vs 0.4 threshold)

**Solution Implemented:**
✅ Fixed `useRecommendedPicksQuery` to use `apiMatchup.uuid` instead of `apiMatchup.id`
✅ All players now get proper UUID matchupIds from API response
✅ Reverted Heavy Favorites filter to simple logic (no more artificial grouping needed)
✅ Filter will now group by actual matchup UUIDs and find heavy favorites correctly

**Key Changes:**
1. **hooks/use-recommended-picks-query.ts**: `matchupId: apiMatchup.uuid` (was `apiMatchup.id`)
2. **filters/implementations/heavy-favorites.ts**: Restored clean grouping logic

**Expected Result:**
- Players should now have proper matchupIds like `abc123-def456-...`
- Filter should create many small groups (2-3 players each) instead of one big group
- Heavy favorites should be found within individual matchups
- Console should show proper matchupId values in debug logs

**Status:** Core issue resolved, ready for testing

<info added on 2025-06-04T00:06:21.363Z>
**FILTERING SYSTEM FULLY FUNCTIONAL! 🎉**

**Final Issue Resolved:**
❌ Heavy Favorites filter found 12 players but 0 showed in UI
❌ Cross-filtering logic was removing all filtered results  
❌ `finalRecommendations` validated against main matchups table, conflicting with sidebar-only filtering

**Solution Implemented:**
✅ Removed cross-filtering validation logic entirely
✅ Simplified: `const finalRecommendations = filteredRecommendations;`
✅ Removed unused `useMatchupsQuery` import and related code
✅ RecommendedPicks now shows filtered results directly without interference

**COMPLETE SYSTEM NOW WORKING:**
✅ **46 matchup groups** created from proper UUIDs  
✅ **12 heavy favorites found** with gaps ≥0.4:
   - Cole, Eric (gap: 1.53), Olesen, Thorbjorn (gap: 1.39)
   - Power, Seamus (gap: 1.3), Castillo, Ricky (gap: 1.19)  
   - McIlroy, Rory (gap: 0.85), and 7 others
✅ **Filter UI** integrated in Dashboard with inline display
✅ **Only affects RecommendedPicks** sidebar (main table unfiltered)
✅ **Performance tracking** and debug logging working
✅ **Architecture** complete: Dashboard → useFilteredPlayers → FilterService → Heavy Favorites → RecommendedPicks

**Integration Status:** COMPLETE ✅
- Filter system fully functional and integrated
- Heavy Favorites filter working as expected  
- UI properly displays filtered recommendations
- Ready for additional filter types and final documentation

**Next:** Task 22.6 ready to be marked as 'done' - core filtering system complete!
