# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Parlay Settlement System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 6, 12, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a robust system that automatically settles 2-ball and 3-ball parlays across multiple tours (PGA, Euro, etc.) when tournaments complete, handling different data sources and settlement logic.
# Details:
The parlay settlement system should be implemented with the following components:

1. **Data Model Enhancement**:
   - Extend the `parlay_picks` table to include `event_id` and `tour_id` fields
   - Add settlement status fields (`settled_at`, `settlement_status`, `settlement_notes`)
   - Create a new `settlement_history` table for audit trails

2. **Multi-Tour Data Source Integration**:
   - Create adapter interfaces for different tour data sources:
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/settlement/adapters/types.ts
   export interface TournamentDataAdapter {
     getTournamentResults(tournamentId: string): Promise<TournamentResults>;
     getPlayerResults(tournamentId: string, playerId: string): Promise<PlayerResult>;
     isTournamentComplete(tournamentId: string): Promise<boolean>;
   }
   
   // Implementation for PGA
   export class PGADataAdapter implements TournamentDataAdapter {
     // Implementation using DataGolf API endpoints
   }
   
   // Implementation for European Tour
   export class EuroTourDataAdapter implements TournamentDataAdapter {
     // Implementation using Euro in-play API
   }
   ```

3. **Intelligent Settlement Logic**:
   - Create settlement strategies for different parlay types:
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/settlement/strategies/types.ts
   export interface SettlementStrategy {
     calculateOutcome(pick: ParlayPick, tournamentData: TournamentResults): PickOutcome;
   }
   
   export class TwoBallSettlementStrategy implements SettlementStrategy {
     // Implementation for head-to-head matchups
   }
   
   export class ThreeBallSettlementStrategy implements SettlementStrategy {
     // Implementation for 3-player groups
   }
   ```
   - Handle edge cases like ties, withdrawals, and disqualifications

4. **Automated Settlement Workflow**:
   - Create a settlement service:
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/settlement/service.ts
   export class ParlaySettlementService {
     async settleTournament(tournamentId: string, tourId: string): Promise<SettlementResult> {
       // 1. Check if tournament is complete
       // 2. Get all unsettled picks for this tournament
       // 3. Apply appropriate settlement strategy for each pick
       // 4. Update pick outcomes
       // 5. Update parlay statuses
       // 6. Record settlement history
     }
     
     async findTournamentsReadyForSettlement(): Promise<TournamentInfo[]> {
       // Logic to detect completed tournaments
     }
   }
   ```
   - Implement a scheduled job to run settlement automatically:
   ```typescript
   // src/app/api/cron/settle-tournaments/route.ts
   export async function POST(request: Request) {
     // Verify cron authentication
     const settlementService = new ParlaySettlementService();
     const tournaments = await settlementService.findTournamentsReadyForSettlement();
     
     const results = await Promise.all(
       tournaments.map(t => settlementService.settleTournament(t.id, t.tourId))
     );
     
     return Response.json({ success: true, results });
   }
   ```

5. **Settlement UI/UX**:
   - Create an admin interface for manual settlement:
   ```typescript
   // src/app/admin/settlement/page.tsx
   export default function SettlementPage() {
     // UI for viewing pending tournaments and triggering settlement
   }
   ```
   - Add settlement status indicators to user parlay views

6. **Settlement Status Tracking**:
   - Implement logging and history tracking:
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/settlement/history.ts
   export async function recordSettlementAction(
     action: SettlementAction,
     parlayIds: string[],
     metadata: SettlementMetadata
   ): Promise<void> {
     // Record to settlement_history table
   }
   ```
   - Create rollback capabilities:
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/settlement/rollback.ts
   export async function rollbackSettlement(
     settlementId: string,
     reason: string
   ): Promise<RollbackResult> {
     // Implement idempotent rollback logic
   }
   ```

7. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**:
   - Implement robust error handling for API failures
   - Create strategies for handling ties in different formats
   - Handle player withdrawals and disqualifications
   - Ensure settlement is idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)

# Test Strategy:
The parlay settlement system should be tested using the following approach:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each settlement strategy with mock tournament data:
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/settlement/strategies/__tests__/two-ball-strategy.test.ts
   describe('TwoBallSettlementStrategy', () => {
     it('should correctly identify winner in head-to-head matchup', () => {
       // Test with mock data
     });
     
     it('should handle ties correctly', () => {
       // Test tie scenarios
     });
     
     it('should handle player withdrawal correctly', () => {
       // Test withdrawal scenarios
     });
   });
   ```
   - Test data adapters with mock API responses
   - Test settlement service with mocked dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Create test fixtures with sample parlays and tournament data
   - Test the end-to-end settlement process with controlled data
   - Verify database updates are correct after settlement

3. **API Tests**:
   - Test the settlement API endpoints with various scenarios
   - Verify authentication and authorization controls

4. **Manual Testing Scenarios**:
   - Create a test tournament with known outcomes
   - Create test parlays with various combinations (wins, losses, ties)
   - Trigger settlement and verify results
   - Test rollback functionality
   - Verify settlement history is recorded correctly

5. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Test with tournaments that have ties
   - Test with tournaments where players have withdrawn
   - Test with tournaments where players are disqualified
   - Test with incomplete tournament data
   - Test settlement of the same tournament multiple times (idempotency)

6. **UI Testing**:
   - Verify settlement status is displayed correctly in admin UI
   - Verify settlement status is displayed correctly in user parlay views
   - Test manual settlement triggers
   - Test settlement history views

7. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test settlement of large numbers of parlays
   - Measure and optimize settlement time

8. **Monitoring Plan**:
   - Set up alerts for failed settlements
   - Create dashboard for settlement statistics
   - Monitor API response times during settlement processes

18. Fixed tour detection bug in TourDataService.getTourType() where tournament.tour field was being ignored in favor of tournament name. Modified the method to prioritize exact matches in the database tour field before falling back to substring matching in tournament names. This ensures Euro Tour events are correctly detected and use the proper API endpoint instead of being misidentified as PGA events.

<info added on 2025-06-07T13:27:58.962Z>
19. Fixed UI display issue where Euro Tour parlays showed placeholder data (all "E" scores, "-" positions) after settlement. The problem occurred because the parlays page fetches from `live_tournament_stats` table which only contained PGA Tour data. Added `populateLiveStats()` method to settlement service that converts Euro Tour PlayerStats to live_tournament_stats format, deletes existing stats for the event to avoid duplicates, inserts round-specific player data in batches, and maps essential fields (player_name, position, total score, today score, thru holes). This method is called automatically after settlement completion, ensuring Euro Tour parlays display actual player scores, positions, and holes played instead of placeholder values.

20. **COMPLETE FIX VERIFIED WORKING**: Fixed Euro Tour parlay settlement issues with multiple improvements: (1) Corrected tour detection in TourDataService.getTourType() to prioritize database tour field over tournament name, (2) Implemented Euro Tour API support with proper round data extraction, (3) Enhanced settlement logic with comprehensive 3-ball/2-ball settlement including cut status handling, and (4) Added populateLiveStats() method to settlement service and populated existing data manually. All Euro Tour parlays now correctly detect as "euro" instead of "pga", settlement API successfully processes picks (verified with 16 picks: 1 win, 3 losses, 12 pushes), UI displays actual player data (scores, positions, holes played), and the complete data flow from DataGolf API through settlement to database and UI works seamlessly.

21. **✅ FINAL SCORE DISPLAY FIX COMPLETE**: Fixed Euro Tour parlays displaying confusing raw scores (+64, +72) instead of proper golf scoring relative to par. Enhanced `populateLiveStats()` method with intelligent score handling that differentiates between historical rounds (converting raw scores to relative-to-par, e.g., 64 → -8 for par 72) and current/live rounds (using existing relative-to-par scores directly). Implemented proper score mapping where `today` shows round score and `total` shows appropriate tournament score. Verified results show correct relative-to-par display (-8, -4, E) instead of confusing raw scores (+64, +72) for both completed and in-progress rounds. This ensures Euro Tour parlays display intuitive golf scores matching standard golf leaderboard formatting throughout the entire data flow from DataGolf API through Settlement to Database and UI.
