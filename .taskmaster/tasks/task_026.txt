Example implementation for responsive table-to-card transformation:
```tsx
// MatchupsTable.tsx
const MatchupsTable = ({ matchups }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Desktop view - traditional table */}
      <div className="hidden md:block">
        <table className="w-full">
          {/* Table implementation */}
        </table>
      </div>
      
      {/* Mobile view - card layout */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:hidden">
        {matchups.map((matchup) => (
          <div key={matchup.id} className="bg-card rounded-lg p-4 shadow">
            <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
              <h3 className="font-semibold">{matchup.teamA} vs {matchup.teamB}</h3>
              <Badge>{matchup.status}</Badge>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-2 space-y-2">
              <div className="flex justify-between text-sm">
                <span className="text-muted-foreground">Date:</span>
                <span>{matchup.date}</span>
              </div>
              {/* Other matchup details */}
            </div>
            <Button variant="outline" className="w-full mt-4">
              View Details
            </Button>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Device Testing Matrix:
   - Test on at least 3 different physical mobile devices with varying screen sizes
   - Test on iOS Safari and Android Chrome at minimum
   - Use Chrome DevTools device emulation for additional device coverage
   - Verify functionality in both portrait and landscape orientations

2. Responsive Breakpoint Testing:
   - Verify layout transitions at each defined breakpoint (sm, md, lg, xl)
   - Confirm no horizontal scrolling occurs at any viewport width
   - Validate that all content remains accessible at all screen sizes
   - Check that text remains readable at all viewport widths

3. Touch Interaction Testing:
   - Verify all interactive elements have touch targets of at least 44x44px
   - Confirm touch feedback is present and appropriate for all interactions
   - Test all custom touch gestures for reliability and accessibility
   - Ensure no essential functions rely solely on hover states

4. Performance Testing:
   - Use Chrome DevTools to simulate slow 3G connections
   - Verify initial load time is acceptable on mobile (under 3 seconds)
   - Confirm scrolling performance is smooth without jank
   - Test memory usage during extended scrolling sessions

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify proper contrast ratios for all text elements
   - Test screen reader compatibility for all interactive elements
   - Confirm keyboard navigation works correctly
   - Validate that focus states are clearly visible

6. Functional Testing:
   - Verify all filtering and sorting functions work correctly on mobile
   - Test data loading and pagination on mobile connections
   - Confirm all matchup details are accessible on mobile
   - Validate that form inputs work correctly with mobile keyboards

7. Visual Regression Testing:
   - Compare screenshots before and after changes at various breakpoints
   - Verify consistent styling and brand adherence across screen sizes
   - Confirm no layout issues with different content lengths

8. User Testing:
   - Conduct usability testing with at least 3 users on mobile devices
   - Document and address any usability issues discovered

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current Mobile Usability Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current mobile usability issues on the matchups page, identifying breakpoints, interaction problems, and performance concerns.
### Details:
Document all breakpoints where layout issues occur (320px, 375px, 414px, etc.). Identify and catalog touch interaction problems including small tap targets, hover-dependent features, and scrolling issues. Assess loading performance on typical mobile networks (3G/4G) using Chrome DevTools throttling. Create a prioritized list of issues to address in subsequent tasks.

## 2. Implement Responsive Container Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Refactor the matchups page container layout to be fully responsive using Tailwind CSS utility classes and proper container constraints.
### Details:
Apply Tailwind's responsive utility classes (sm:, md:, lg:) to adjust container width, padding, and margins at different breakpoints. Implement proper max-width constraints to prevent excessive stretching on larger mobile devices. Ensure proper scrolling behavior with appropriate overflow handling. Add responsive padding (px-4 sm:px-6 md:px-8) and adjust spacing between elements for mobile viewing.

## 3. Convert MatchupsTable to Mobile-Friendly Format [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Transform the horizontal table layout into a card-based layout for small screens while maintaining the table view for larger screens.
### Details:
Implement conditional rendering using Tailwind's responsive classes to show table on desktop (hidden md:block) and cards on mobile (block md:hidden). Create card components that display the same data as table rows but in a vertical format. Add touch-friendly buttons for expandable content sections. Ensure each card has adequate spacing and clear visual hierarchy. Optimize typography for readability on small screens using responsive text utilities.

## 4. Optimize Filter Components for Touch Interaction [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Redesign filter components to be touch-friendly and mobile-optimized using appropriate mobile UI patterns.
### Details:
Convert filter dropdowns to bottom sheet interfaces on mobile using a conditional rendering approach. Implement larger touch targets (min 44x44px) for all interactive filter elements. Add visible active states and clear visual indicators for selected filters. Consider implementing a collapsible filter section that expands when needed. Use Shadcn UI Dialog or Sheet components for full-screen filter interfaces when appropriate. Add a prominent 'Apply Filters' button with proper spacing from other controls.

## 5. Implement Performance Optimizations and Final Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.3, 26.4
### Description: Apply mobile-specific performance optimizations and conduct comprehensive testing across devices and browsers.
### Details:
Implement lazy loading for matchup data when scrolling using Intersection Observer or a React virtualization library. Optimize and properly size images with responsive image techniques. Add appropriate loading states for mobile connections. Implement a 'back to top' button for long lists. Test and fix any remaining touch interaction issues. Ensure proper integration with mobile browser navigation including back button behavior. Conduct final cross-browser testing on iOS Safari and Android Chrome.
