# Task ID: 27
# Title: Enhance Matchup Data Fetching to Include SG Stats
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 22, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the matchup data fetching layer to include Strokes Gained (SG) statistics from relevant database tables, enabling filters like SG Heavy to access season-long and tournament SG data.
# Details:
This task involves extending the current matchup data fetching implementation to include Strokes Gained statistics from multiple database tables. The implementation should follow these steps:

1. **Analyze Current Data Flow**:
   - Review the existing matchup query implementation in the API layer
   - Identify where and how matchup data is currently fetched
   - Document the current data structure returned to the client

2. **Database Schema Analysis**:
   - Examine the structure of the `player_skill_ratings`, `player_season_stats`, and `live_tournament_stats` tables
   - Identify the relevant SG fields needed for filtering (likely including SG:OTT, SG:APP, SG:ARG, SG:PUTT, and SG:T2G)
   - Determine the appropriate join conditions between matchup tables and these SG data tables

3. **Query Modification**:
   - Extend the existing SQL queries to include JOIN operations with the SG data tables
   - Ensure proper aliasing to avoid column name conflicts
   - Add the relevant SG fields to the SELECT clause
   - Optimize the query to minimize performance impact (consider indexing if needed)

4. **API Response Enhancement**:
   - Update the API response structure to include the new SG data fields
   - Ensure backward compatibility for existing consumers
   - Document the new fields in API documentation

5. **Type Definition Updates**:
   - Extend TypeScript interfaces for matchup data to include SG statistics
   - Update any related type definitions that depend on matchup data structure

6. **Integration with Filtering System**:
   - Verify that the enhanced data structure properly feeds into the existing filtering system
   - Test specifically with the SG Heavy filter to ensure it can access and utilize the SG data

7. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Implement data caching if the enhanced queries impact performance
   - Consider pagination or lazy loading if the data payload size increases significantly

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the modified data fetching functions
   - Verify that the correct SQL joins are being generated
   - Test edge cases like missing SG data for certain players

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the complete data flow from database to frontend
   - Verify that all SG fields are correctly populated in the API response
   - Ensure no regression in existing functionality

3. **Filter Functionality Testing**:
   - Test the SG Heavy filter with the enhanced data
   - Verify that matchups are correctly filtered based on SG criteria
   - Compare filter results with manual calculations to ensure accuracy

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure and compare API response times before and after the changes
   - Verify that the enhanced queries don't significantly impact performance
   - Test with realistic data volumes to ensure scalability

5. **UI Verification**:
   - Verify that the matchups page correctly displays any new SG data
   - Ensure that filters using SG data work as expected in the UI
   - Test on different devices and browsers to ensure consistent behavior

6. **Database Query Analysis**:
   - Use database query analysis tools to verify the efficiency of the new joins
   - Check execution plans to identify any potential performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize indexes if necessary based on the analysis

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current Data Flow and Database Schema [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review existing matchup query implementation and database schema to identify integration points for SG statistics
### Details:
Examine the current matchup data fetching implementation in the API layer. Document how data flows from database to client. Analyze the structure of relevant tables (player_skill_ratings, player_season_stats, live_tournament_stats) to identify SG fields needed for filtering. Map relationships between matchup tables and SG data tables to determine appropriate join conditions.

## Current Data Flow Analysis Complete ✅

**Current Matchup Data Flow:**
1. **API Layer**: `/api/matchups/route.ts` queries `latest_matchups` view
2. **Server Actions**: `app/actions/matchups.ts` `getMatchups()` function:
   - Fetches from `matchups` table 
   - Looks up player stats from `player_stats` table but **ONLY gets `sg_total`**
   - Returns processed matchups with minimal SG data

**Key Issue Identified:**
The current implementation only fetches `sg_total` from a `player_stats` table, but we have rich SG data in multiple tables that aren't being utilized:

**Available SG Data Tables:**
1. **`player_skill_ratings`** (Data Golf season stats) - Contains: `sg_total`, `sg_putt`, `sg_arg`, `sg_app`, `sg_ott`, `driving_acc`, `driving_dist`
2. **`player_season_stats`** (PGA Tour season stats) - Same SG fields as above
3. **`latest_live_tournament_stats_view`** (tournament/live stats) - Contains: `sg_total`, `sg_putt`, `sg_arg`, `sg_app`, `sg_ott`, `sg_t2g` + position/scores

**Data Structure Analysis:**
- **TypeScript interfaces exist** in `types/definitions.ts` for all SG data types
- **React Query hooks exist** (`usePlayerTableQuery`) that successfully fetch from these tables
- **Filter expects** data with fields like `sgTotal`, `seasonSgTotal`, `sg_total` etc.

**Integration Points Identified:**
1. **Hook Integration**: `hooks/use-matchups-query.ts` needs to fetch enhanced data
2. **API Enhancement**: `/api/matchups/route.ts` needs to JOIN with SG tables  
3. **Server Action Update**: `getMatchups()` function needs SG data lookup
4. **Type Updates**: Matchup interfaces need SG field extensions

**Next Steps Ready**: 
- Modify queries to JOIN with SG tables using `dg_id` as foreign key
- Extend matchup data structure to include season + tournament SG fields
- Update React Query hooks to handle enhanced data structure

## 2. Extend Database Queries with SG Data Joins [done]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Modify existing SQL queries to include JOIN operations with SG data tables and select relevant SG fields
### Details:
Update SQL queries in the data access layer to join with the SG data tables. Add appropriate JOIN conditions based on player IDs or other relevant keys. Include SG fields (SG:OTT, SG:APP, SG:ARG, SG:PUTT, SG:T2G) in the SELECT clause with proper aliasing to avoid column conflicts. Optimize queries with appropriate indexing if performance testing indicates issues.

## Database Query Enhancement Complete ✅

**API Route Enhanced** (`/api/matchups/route.ts`):
- Modified GET endpoint to fetch SG data from multiple sources
- **Season-long SG data** from `player_skill_ratings` table (Data Golf): `sg_total`, `sg_putt`, `sg_arg`, `sg_app`, `sg_ott`, `driving_acc`, `driving_dist`
- **Tournament SG data** from `latest_live_tournament_stats_view`: `sg_total`, `sg_putt`, `sg_arg`, `sg_app`, `sg_ott`, `sg_t2g`, `position`, `total`, `today`, `thru`
- **Enhanced data structure**: Each matchup now includes `player1_sg_data`, `player2_sg_data`, `player3_sg_data` objects containing both season and tournament stats
- **Performance optimized**: Uses efficient Map-based lookups and batched queries
- **Backward compatible**: Maintains all existing fields and API structure

**Data Flow Logic**:
1. Fetch base matchup data from `latest_matchups` view
2. Extract unique player IDs from all matchups
3. Batch fetch season SG data for all players
4. Batch fetch tournament SG data for all players  
5. Merge data into enhanced matchup objects with nested SG data

**Enhanced Data Structure**:
```typescript
{
  ...matchup, // existing fields
  player1_sg_data: {
    // Season data (always available)
    seasonSgTotal, seasonSgPutt, seasonSgArg, seasonSgApp, seasonSgOtt,
    // Tournament data (when available)
    sgTotal, sgPutt, sgArg, sgApp, sgOtt, sgT2g, position, total, today, thru
  },
  // same for player2_sg_data, player3_sg_data
  sg_data_enhanced: true, // flag indicating enhanced data
  season_sg_players: number, // count for debugging
  tournament_sg_players: number // count for debugging
}
```

## Fixed SG Data Loss Issue in Data Transformation ✅

**Root Cause Identified:**
The SG Heavy filter was receiving no SG data because the `useFilteredPlayers` hook was hardcoding `sgTotal: 0` when transforming enhanced matchup data to Player format, losing all the SG information.

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Enhanced Data Extraction**: Added `extractSGData()` helper function to properly extract SG data from nested `player1_sg_data`, `player2_sg_data`, `player3_sg_data` objects
2. **Tournament/Season SG Prioritization**: Prefers tournament SG data when available, falls back to season SG data
3. **Filter Architecture Update**: Updated SG Heavy filter to work with Player data format instead of MatchupRow format to maintain consistency with filtering system
4. **Type Safety**: Fixed matchupId type consistency (UUID strings)
5. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track SG data extraction and transformation

**Expected Resolution:**
- SG-enhanced matchup data should now properly transform to Player objects with valid SG data
- SG Heavy filter should receive players with sgTotal and seasonSgTotal values
- Filter should successfully identify and process players with SG data
- UI should display recommendations based on comprehensive SG analysis

**Next Step:** Test the complete data flow from API → transformation → filter → results
