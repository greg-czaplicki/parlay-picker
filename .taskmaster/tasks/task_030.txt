# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Tournament Snapshot Database Architecture for ML and Trend Analysis
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 12, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a parallel snapshot-based data collection system that preserves historical tournament states at each round completion, enabling ML features like position tracking, momentum analysis, and predictive modeling.
# Details:
This task involves designing and implementing a comprehensive tournament snapshot database architecture to support ML and trend analysis:

1. **Database Schema Design**:
   - Create a new `tournament_snapshots` table with fields for tournament_id, round_number, snapshot_timestamp, and a JSON blob containing the full leaderboard state
   - Design a `player_round_snapshots` table to store individual player stats at each round completion
   - Implement position_change and momentum_indicators fields to track player movement
   - Create appropriate indexes for efficient querying by tournament, player, and round

2. **Snapshot Generation System**:
   - Develop a trigger mechanism that activates at round completion
   - Implement a data capture service that creates a complete denormalized copy of the tournament state
   - Ensure the snapshot system runs asynchronously to avoid impacting the live tournament system
   - Add validation to verify snapshot data integrity before storage

3. **Position Change Tracking**:
   - Calculate and store position deltas between consecutive rounds
   - Implement a weighted momentum score based on recent position changes
   - Create utility functions to analyze position trends over multiple rounds

4. **API Layer Development**:
   - Create new API endpoints to access historical snapshots
   - Implement query parameters for filtering by tournament, round, player, and time period
   - Add endpoints specifically designed for ML data extraction with appropriate data formats

5. **Integration with Existing System**:
   - Ensure the snapshot system operates in parallel without disrupting the current live tournament functionality
   - Add hooks in the existing tournament update flow to trigger snapshot creation
   - Implement fallback mechanisms to the live data when snapshots aren't available

6. **ML Data Preparation**:
   - Create denormalized data views optimized for machine learning
   - Implement feature extraction utilities for common ML scenarios
   - Add metadata to snapshots to facilitate training/testing dataset creation

7. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Implement appropriate partitioning for the snapshot tables based on tournament_id and date
   - Add compression for historical snapshots to minimize storage requirements
   - Create a data retention policy for managing snapshot lifecycle

Example implementation for snapshot trigger:
```typescript
// src/lib/tournament/snapshotService.ts
export async function createTournamentSnapshot(tournamentId: number, roundNumber: number) {
  try {
    // 1. Fetch current tournament state
    const tournamentData = await fetchCompleteTournamentData(tournamentId);
    
    // 2. Calculate position changes from previous round
    const previousSnapshot = await getPreviousRoundSnapshot(tournamentId, roundNumber - 1);
    const playersWithPositionChanges = calculatePositionChanges(tournamentData.players, previousSnapshot);
    
    // 3. Calculate momentum indicators
    const playersWithMomentum = calculateMomentumIndicators(playersWithPositionChanges);
    
    // 4. Create and store the snapshot
    const snapshot = {
      tournament_id: tournamentId,
      round_number: roundNumber,
      snapshot_timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      leaderboard_state: playersWithMomentum,
      metadata: {
        round_complete: true,
        player_count: playersWithMomentum.length,
        cut_line: tournamentData.cutLine
      }
    };
    
    await db.tournament_snapshots.insert(snapshot);
    
    // 5. Store individual player snapshots
    await storePlayerSnapshots(playersWithMomentum, tournamentId, roundNumber);
    
    return { success: true, snapshotId: snapshot.id };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to create tournament snapshot:", error);
    return { success: false, error };
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
To verify the correct implementation of the Tournament Snapshot Database Architecture:

1. **Database Schema Validation**:
   - Verify all required tables (`tournament_snapshots`, `player_round_snapshots`) are created with correct fields and constraints
   - Confirm indexes are properly set up for efficient querying
   - Test data integrity constraints by attempting to insert invalid data

2. **Snapshot Generation Testing**:
   - Create a mock tournament completion event and verify a snapshot is automatically generated
   - Compare the snapshot data with the source tournament data to ensure complete and accurate capture
   - Test the system with tournaments of varying sizes (small, medium, large player counts)
   - Verify snapshots are created for each round completion

3. **Position Change Calculation Testing**:
   - Create test fixtures with known position changes between rounds
   - Verify the position_change calculations match expected values
   - Test edge cases like tied positions, players who missed the cut, and withdrawals

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure the time taken to generate snapshots for tournaments of different sizes
   - Verify snapshot generation doesn't impact the performance of the live tournament system
   - Test concurrent snapshot generation for multiple tournaments

5. **API Integration Testing**:
   - Verify all new API endpoints return the expected data in the correct format
   - Test filtering capabilities with various query parameters
   - Confirm proper error handling for invalid requests

6. **ML Data Readiness Testing**:
   - Verify the denormalized data format is suitable for common ML algorithms
   - Test feature extraction utilities with sample data
   - Create a simple ML model using the snapshot data to validate usability

7. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Simulate a complete tournament lifecycle and verify snapshots at each stage
   - Test the reconstruction of historical tournament states from snapshots
   - Verify momentum calculations across multiple rounds

8. **Regression Testing**:
   - Confirm existing tournament functionality continues to work without disruption
   - Verify live data updates still function correctly alongside the snapshot system

# Tournament Snapshot System Implementation

## Automatic Trigger System
- Round Completion Detection: Monitors 80% player completion threshold
- Significant Progress Detection: Triggers when avg thru >= 15 holes with positions
- Duplicate Prevention: Won't create snapshots within 1 hour of existing ones
- Smart Filtering: Skips insufficient player counts (< 10 players)

## Queue-Based Async Processing
- Non-blocking Operation: Snapshots process asynchronously to avoid impacting live sync
- Retry Logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s delays)
- Error Handling: Graceful failure without tournament sync disruption
- Background Processing: Uses Promise-based queuing system

## Comprehensive Validation System
- Data Integrity Checks: Validates player counts, position data, scores
- Completeness Scoring: Calculates 0-1 score for data quality
- Stale Data Detection: Warns if data is older than 2 hours
- Round Consistency: Ensures round number consistency across players

## Integration With Existing Sync
- Hooked into `/api/live-stats/sync`: Automatically triggers after successful sync
- Hooked into `/api/live-stats/sync-tour`: Triggers on individual tour syncs
- Non-intrusive: Snapshot failures don't break existing tournament data flow
- Selective Triggering: Skips 'event_avg' rounds, focuses on actual rounds 1-4

## Monitoring & Testing API
- GET `/api/snapshots`: View system status, recent snapshots, summaries
- POST `/api/snapshots`: Manually trigger snapshots for testing
- PUT `/api/snapshots`: Test trigger logic without creating actual snapshots

## Workflow
1. Tournament sync runs (every few minutes during active tournaments)
2. After successful upsert, system checks each round for completion
3. If round is 80%+ complete, snapshot is queued asynchronously
4. Validation ensures data quality before creating snapshot
5. Snapshot captures complete tournament state with position changes
6. ML tables populated with historical data ready for analysis

## 3. Implement position change tracking and momentum indicators [done]
### Dependencies: 30.2
### Description: Calculate and store position changes between rounds and implement momentum indicators to track player performance trends.
### Details:
Calculate position deltas between consecutive rounds for each player. Implement a weighted momentum score based on recent position changes (more weight to recent rounds). Create utility functions to analyze position trends over multiple rounds. Store these calculations in the player_round_snapshots table. Implement visualization-ready data formats for trend analysis.
