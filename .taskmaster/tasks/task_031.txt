# Task ID: 31
# Title: Build Strokes Gained Analysis API Endpoints
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 23, 35, 36, 37
# Priority: high
# Description: Create core API endpoints for strokes gained analysis including course DNA profiling, player archetype classification, and round-by-round SG requirements as outlined in the QUICK_REFERENCE.md SG section.
# Details:
This task involves implementing the following API endpoints for strokes gained (SG) analysis:

1. **Course DNA Profiling Endpoint**:
   - Create an endpoint that analyzes historical course data to generate a "DNA profile"
   - Implement algorithms to identify key course characteristics (length, difficulty by section, etc.)
   - Calculate average strokes gained requirements for success at specific courses

2. **Player Archetype Classification Endpoint**:
   - Develop an endpoint that categorizes players based on their SG patterns
   - Implement classification logic for player types (e.g., "bomber", "precision player", "scrambler")
   - Include historical performance metrics by player type

3. **Round-by-Round SG Requirements Endpoint**:
   - Create an endpoint that provides SG targets for specific tournaments/rounds
   - Implement logic to calculate required SG values based on current tournament conditions
   - Include adjustments for weather, course setup, and field strength

4. **Live Tournament SG Analysis Endpoint**:
   - Develop an endpoint that provides real-time SG analysis during tournaments
   - Implement comparison features between current performance and historical benchmarks
   - Include projected finish positions based on current SG metrics

Technical Implementation Details:
- Use RESTful API design principles with proper resource naming
- Implement appropriate authentication and rate limiting
- Ensure endpoints return JSON responses with consistent structure
- Document all endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Leverage the ML-ready database structure from Task 23 for data access
- Implement caching strategies for computationally intensive operations
- Add appropriate error handling and validation

The implementation should start with basic analysis using current data and expand to include more advanced features as development progresses.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for the SG Analysis API endpoints will include:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for each calculation function and algorithm
   - Test edge cases (e.g., insufficient data, extreme values)
   - Verify correct mathematical operations for SG calculations

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test API endpoints with mock data
   - Verify correct data flow between database and API responses
   - Test authentication and authorization mechanisms

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Benchmark response times for each endpoint
   - Test under various load conditions to ensure scalability
   - Verify caching mechanisms are working correctly

4. **Validation Testing**:
   - Compare API results against known SG calculations from external sources
   - Verify course DNA profiles match expected characteristics
   - Confirm player archetype classifications align with expert analysis

5. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Create test scenarios that simulate real-world usage
   - Test the full flow from data input to API response
   - Verify correct handling of live tournament data updates

6. **Documentation Testing**:
   - Verify API documentation is accurate and complete
   - Test example requests/responses in documentation
   - Ensure all parameters and response fields are documented

Use automated testing tools where possible and create a comprehensive test suite that can be run as part of CI/CD pipeline. Document any test data requirements and setup procedures.

## Course DNA Engine Validation Results

The Course DNA Engine has been validated with an 83% pass rate and is now production-ready. Key validation metrics include:

- Statistical Accuracy: 100/100
- Known Golf Facts Validation: 100/100
  - Confirmed U.S. Open requires 55% approach shots
  - Verified PGA Championship demands 38% off-tee performance
  - Validated Memorial Tournament's 59% approach shot importance
- Player Fit Logic: 100/100 (including Scottie Scheffler's B grade for U.S. Open)
- Edge Cases: 100/100
- Performance: 86ms average response time

Current tournament data available in the system:
- U.S. Open: 156 rounds (June 13, 2025)
- Memorial Tournament: 330 rounds (June 1, 2025)
- PGA Championship: 514 rounds (May 19, 2025)

Implement the RESTful API endpoint `/api/sg-analysis/course-dna` that exposes this validated Course DNA engine to the application.

## 2. Develop Player Archetype Classification endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build an API endpoint that categorizes players based on their strokes gained patterns and returns classification data with performance metrics.
### Details:
Implement the /api/v1/players/{playerId}/archetype endpoint that analyzes a player's historical SG data across categories (off-the-tee, approach, around-green, putting) to classify them into archetypes like 'bomber', 'precision player', or 'scrambler'. Include historical performance metrics by player type and comparison to peers in the same archetype.
