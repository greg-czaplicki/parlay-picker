# Task ID: 32
# Title: Create ML-Powered Parlay Recommendation Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31, 35
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a core recommendation engine that analyzes Strokes Gained data and historical snapshots to suggest optimal parlay combinations, focusing on player-course fit, recent form, and SG momentum patterns.
# Details:
This task involves building a machine learning recommendation system for golf betting parlays:

1. **Data Integration and Preprocessing**:
   - Connect to the Strokes Gained API endpoints to access player performance metrics
   - Implement data pipelines to collect and preprocess historical performance data
   - Create feature engineering functions to extract relevant patterns (player-course fit, momentum, etc.)
   - Normalize and standardize input features for model consumption

2. **Model Development**:
   - Implement a multi-stage recommendation approach:
     - Stage 1: Player-course fit analysis using SG data and course DNA profiles
     - Stage 2: Form analysis examining recent performance trends and momentum
     - Stage 3: Matchup probability calculations for 3-ball and head-to-head scenarios
   - Start with simpler models (logistic regression, random forests) that can be trained on limited data
   - Design the system to improve as more data accumulates (model versioning)
   - Implement confidence scoring for recommendations

3. **Recommendation Engine Logic**:
   - Create algorithms to identify optimal parlay combinations based on model outputs
   - Implement risk-reward balancing to suggest parlays with different risk profiles
   - Design a recommendation scoring system that considers both win probability and potential payout
   - Build logic to filter out conflicting or redundant selections

4. **API Development**:
   - Create endpoints to serve recommendations based on user preferences
   - Implement parameter controls for risk tolerance, parlay size, and bet types
   - Design the response format to include confidence metrics and supporting data

5. **Feedback Loop Implementation**:
   - Create a system to track recommendation performance
   - Implement automated model retraining based on new outcomes
   - Design metrics to evaluate recommendation quality over time

6. **Documentation**:
   - Document model architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics
   - Create API documentation for frontend integration
   - Document the recommendation algorithm logic and parameters

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test data preprocessing functions with sample datasets
   - Verify feature engineering logic produces expected outputs
   - Test model prediction functions with controlled inputs
   - Validate recommendation algorithms with predefined scenarios

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify correct data flow from SG API endpoints to recommendation engine
   - Test end-to-end recommendation generation with real historical data
   - Validate API response formats and error handling

3. **Model Validation**:
   - Implement cross-validation to assess model performance
   - Create backtesting framework to evaluate recommendations against historical outcomes
   - Establish baseline metrics (accuracy, ROI, etc.) for model performance evaluation
   - Test model performance across different tournament types and conditions

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Benchmark recommendation generation time under various load conditions
   - Test system performance with increasing data volumes
   - Verify scalability of the recommendation engine

5. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Create a test environment for stakeholders to review recommendations
   - Collect feedback on recommendation quality and relevance
   - Compare manual expert picks against system recommendations

6. **Monitoring Plan**:
   - Implement logging for model predictions and recommendation outcomes
   - Create dashboards to track recommendation performance over time
   - Set up alerts for significant deviations in model performance
