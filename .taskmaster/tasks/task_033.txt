# Task ID: 33
# Title: Build SG Analysis Dashboard Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a frontend dashboard that displays course DNA profiles, player archetype analysis, and real-time SG insights with course comparison tools, player-course fit analysis, and visual representations of SG data.
# Details:
This task involves building a functional frontend dashboard for Strokes Gained analysis:

1. **Core Dashboard Components**:
   - Create main dashboard layout with responsive grid system
   - Implement navigation between different SG analysis views
   - Build data visualization components for SG metrics (charts, graphs, heatmaps)
   - Design course DNA profile display with key characteristics highlighted

2. **Course Comparison Tools**:
   - Develop side-by-side course DNA profile comparison interface
   - Implement filtering and sorting capabilities for course attributes
   - Create visual overlays to highlight similarities/differences between courses
   - Build historical performance comparison for selected players across courses

3. **Player Archetype Analysis**:
   - Design player archetype classification display with visual indicators
   - Implement player search and filtering functionality
   - Create player-to-player comparison tools for archetype analysis
   - Build trend visualization for player performance by course type

4. **Player-Course Fit Analysis**:
   - Develop interface showing compatibility scores between players and courses
   - Implement color-coded indicators for strong/weak player-course matches
   - Create detailed breakdown views of specific player-course combinations
   - Build historical performance overlay for selected player-course pairs

5. **Real-time SG Insights**:
   - Design real-time data display components with auto-refresh capabilities
   - Implement tournament progress tracking with SG metrics
   - Create alert indicators for significant SG performance shifts
   - Build round-by-round SG comparison tools

6. **Integration with Recommendation Engine**:
   - Develop UI components to display parlay recommendations
   - Implement filters to customize recommendation parameters
   - Create visual indicators for recommendation confidence levels
   - Build detailed explanation views for recommendation logic

7. **Data Fetching and State Management**:
   - Implement API service layer to fetch data from SG Analysis endpoints
   - Create state management structure for dashboard components
   - Implement caching strategies for performance optimization
   - Build error handling and loading states for data fetching

8. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Use React.js for component architecture
   - Implement D3.js or Chart.js for data visualizations
   - Utilize CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layouts
   - Focus on functional implementation over visual polish for alpha testing

# Test Strategy:
1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Verify all dashboard components render correctly with test data
   - Confirm navigation between different views works as expected
   - Test all interactive elements (filters, selectors, buttons) function properly
   - Validate that course comparison tools display accurate information
   - Ensure player archetype analysis components show correct classifications
   - Verify player-course fit analysis displays appropriate compatibility metrics
   - Test real-time SG insights update with new data

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Validate API integration with SG Analysis endpoints
   - Confirm recommendation engine data is properly displayed
   - Test data flow between different dashboard components
   - Verify state management correctly handles data updates
   - Ensure error states are properly handled and displayed

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure initial load time of dashboard components
   - Test dashboard performance with large datasets
   - Verify responsiveness across different screen sizes
   - Measure time for data refresh and component updates

4. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Create test scenarios for common user workflows
   - Conduct alpha testing sessions with internal stakeholders
   - Document usability issues and prioritize fixes
   - Verify dashboard provides valuable insights for target users

5. **Cross-browser Testing**:
   - Test dashboard functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify visualizations render correctly across browsers
   - Ensure responsive design works on different devices and browsers

6. **Specific Test Cases**:
   - Test course DNA profile display with at least 5 different course profiles
   - Verify player archetype analysis with players from each classification
   - Test course comparison with courses of varying characteristics
   - Validate player-course fit analysis with known good/poor fit examples
   - Test recommendation display with various confidence levels
