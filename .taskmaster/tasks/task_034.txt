# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Live Tournament SG Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build real-time integration that analyzes current tournament conditions (weather, pin positions, course setup) and adjusts Strokes Gained analysis accordingly, providing live momentum tracking, round-by-round SG performance, and dynamic course DNA adjustments.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a real-time Strokes Gained (SG) analysis system that adapts to live tournament conditions:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - Implement API connectors to ingest live tournament data including weather conditions, pin positions, and course setup changes
   - Create a caching mechanism to store current tournament state with appropriate TTL values
   - Develop a change detection system to identify significant tournament condition changes

2. **SG Analysis Adjustment Engine**:
   - Build algorithms to adjust baseline SG calculations based on current conditions
   - Implement weighting factors for different conditions (e.g., wind speed/direction impact on driving, rain impact on putting)
   - Create a normalization layer to ensure SG comparisons remain valid across changing conditions

3. **Live Momentum Tracking**:
   - Develop a sliding-window algorithm to calculate player momentum based on recent hole performance
   - Implement statistical significance checks to distinguish real momentum from random variance
   - Create visualization data structures for momentum representation (direction, magnitude, duration)

4. **Round-by-Round SG Performance**:
   - Build a real-time aggregation system for SG metrics by round
   - Implement comparative analysis between current round and historical performance
   - Create delta calculations to highlight performance changes in specific SG categories

5. **Dynamic Course DNA Adjustments**:
   - Extend the existing Course DNA system to incorporate real-time condition adjustments
   - Implement a weighting algorithm that blends historical course DNA with current conditions
   - Create an API endpoint that provides the current effective Course DNA profile

6. **Integration with Existing SG API**:
   - Extend the existing SG API endpoints to include condition-adjusted values
   - Implement versioning to allow clients to request raw or adjusted SG metrics
   - Create documentation for the new condition-adjusted endpoints

7. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Implement background processing for computationally intensive adjustments
   - Design a caching strategy for frequently accessed adjusted SG metrics
   - Create a fallback mechanism if live data feeds become unavailable

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for each adjustment algorithm using mock tournament condition data
   - Verify that SG calculations correctly adjust based on different weather scenarios
   - Test boundary conditions (extreme weather, rapid condition changes)

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Set up a test environment with simulated live tournament data feeds
   - Verify that the system correctly integrates with the existing SG API endpoints
   - Test the complete flow from condition change to adjusted SG metrics

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure response times for adjusted SG calculations under various load conditions
   - Verify that caching mechanisms effectively reduce computation time for repeated requests
   - Test system behavior during simulated data feed interruptions

4. **Validation Testing**:
   - Compare adjusted SG predictions against actual tournament outcomes using historical data
   - Verify that momentum tracking correlates with subsequent player performance
   - Validate that dynamic Course DNA adjustments accurately reflect playing difficulty

5. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Create a test dashboard displaying live-adjusted SG metrics during an actual tournament
   - Have golf analysts review the adjusted metrics for accuracy and usefulness
   - Collect feedback on the most valuable condition-adjusted insights

6. **Regression Testing**:
   - Verify that existing SG functionality continues to work correctly
   - Ensure that raw (unadjusted) SG metrics remain available and accurate
   - Test backward compatibility with existing API clients

7. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Review API documentation for completeness and accuracy
   - Verify that all new endpoints and parameters are properly documented
   - Ensure examples accurately demonstrate the condition-adjusted functionality
