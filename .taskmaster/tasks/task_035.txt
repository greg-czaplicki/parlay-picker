# Task ID: 35
# Title: Build Strokes Gained Calculation Engine
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive Strokes Gained (SG) analysis engine that leverages DataGolf API data to power all SG analysis, implementing advanced analytics for course profiling, player classification, and performance prediction.
# Details:
The Strokes Gained (SG) Analysis Engine should be implemented as a modular service with the following components:

1. SG Data Analysis Service:
   - Integrate with DataGolf API to access official PGA Tour SG metrics
   - Process player_skill_ratings for season SG averages
   - Analyze live_tournament_stats for tournament-specific performance
   - Utilize tournament_round_snapshots for historical SG data with 15-year retention
   - Implement field-relative analysis to properly contextualize SG metrics

2. Course DNA Profiling:
   - Develop algorithms to identify course-specific SG patterns
   - Create course profiles based on historical SG data across all categories
   - Quantify which SG categories each course rewards most
   - Build course similarity metrics based on SG signature patterns

3. Player SG Archetype Classification:
   - Implement clustering algorithms to group players by SG signatures
   - Create player archetypes (e.g., "elite driver, average putter")
   - Track player development and archetype transitions over time
   - Identify complementary player types for team competitions

4. SG-Based Course Fit Analysis:
   - Match player SG strengths to course requirements
   - Develop predictive models for player performance at specific venues
   - Quantify course fit scores based on player SG profiles
   - Create visualization tools for course fit analysis

5. Live SG Momentum Tracking:
   - Implement real-time analysis of SG trends during tournaments
   - Identify hot/cold streaks in specific SG categories
   - Develop momentum indicators based on recent SG performance
   - Create alerts for significant SG pattern changes

6. Performance Optimization:
   - Ensure analyses are efficient for large historical datasets
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed SG data
   - Consider parallel processing for batch analyses

The implementation should leverage the ML-ready data structure from Task 23, ensuring compatibility with the normalized betting data format and feature snapshots. All SG analysis should recognize that SG is field-relative and course-specific, defined as "per round average better/worse than FIELD AVERAGE on same course & event" in accordance with Mark Broadie's methodology.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for each SG analysis function
   - Test with known input/output pairs validated against published SG data
   - Verify edge cases (tournament outliers, course extremes, etc.)
   - Test handling of missing or incomplete data

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify integration with DataGolf API data sources
   - Test end-to-end analysis pipeline with sample tournament data
   - Validate results against published PGA Tour SG statistics

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark analysis speed for single rounds, tournaments, and seasons
   - Test with large historical datasets to ensure scalability
   - Verify memory usage remains within acceptable limits

4. Validation Testing:
   - Compare analysis results against known course characteristics
   - Verify player archetype classifications match expert assessments
   - Ensure course fit predictions align with historical performance

5. API Testing:
   - Verify all API endpoints return correct results
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Validate documentation accuracy with example calls

6. Regression Testing:
   - Create a suite of regression tests to ensure future changes don't break analyses
   - Include historical tournament data with known SG patterns

7. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have golf analytics experts review the analysis outputs
   - Verify the results match intuitive expectations for known player-course relationships

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core SG Category Functions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the fundamental mathematical functions for calculating strokes gained in each category (OTT, APP, ARG, PUTT).
### Details:
Create separate functions for each SG category with appropriate parameters: SG_OTT(distance, lie, outcome), SG_APP(distance, lie, outcome), SG_ARG(distance, lie, outcome), and SG_PUTT(distance, outcome). Each function should calculate the difference between expected strokes from the starting position and expected strokes from the ending position, plus one stroke for the shot taken. Implement shot classification logic to determine which category a shot belongs to based on distance from hole, lie type, and other factors.

## Course Correction: Pivoting to Data-Driven SG Approach

After reviewing feedback, we're pivoting from building theoretical SG calculations to working with actual PGA Tour ShotLink data:

1. Research Requirements:
   - Investigate PGA Tour ShotLink data access options (API, data feeds, partnerships)
   - Study Mark Broadie's methodology for SG calculations
   - Analyze how field averages are subtracted for each round
   - Examine real benchmark data from current SG leaders (Wallace, Manassero, Im)

2. Data Integration Plan:
   - Create data importers for PGA Tour SG statistics
   - Develop database schema to store official SG metrics by player/tournament/round
   - Build normalization tools to handle different course conditions
   - Implement field-average adjustment calculations

3. Repurpose Current Work:
   - Convert theoretical calculation engine to validation/verification tool
   - Use existing type system for data modeling
   - Adapt shot classification logic for data analysis rather than calculation
   - Maintain test coverage for new data-driven approach

4. New Deliverables:
   - PGA Tour data connector service
   - SG data aggregation and analysis tools
   - Course-specific and player-specific SG trend analysis
   - Visualization components for SG metrics

This pivot ensures we're working with industry-standard SG metrics rather than attempting to recreate the complex statistical baselines already established by the PGA Tour.
