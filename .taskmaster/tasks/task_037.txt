# Task ID: 37
# Title: Build Course & Player Normalization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a system to standardize course names, map venues to their characteristics, and maintain consistent player identification across different data sources.
# Details:
This task involves building a comprehensive normalization system with the following components:

1. **Course Metadata Database**:
   - Design and implement a database schema for storing standardized course information
   - Include fields for course name variations, official names, location data, course characteristics (length, par, difficulty rating, etc.)
   - Create ETL processes to populate the database from various data sources
   - Implement fuzzy matching algorithms to identify and link variant course names

2. **Player Identification System**:
   - Develop a player mapping table that links different player IDs across data sources
   - Create a master player record with canonical information (full name, DOB, country, etc.)
   - Implement a resolution system for handling name variations, misspellings, and aliases
   - Build APIs for player lookup, verification, and metadata retrieval

3. **Data Quality Validation Framework**:
   - Create validation rules for course and player data
   - Implement automated checks for data consistency and completeness
   - Build reporting tools to identify normalization issues
   - Design workflows for manual review and correction of edge cases

4. **Integration with Existing Systems**:
   - Modify data ingestion pipelines to use the normalization system
   - Update existing queries and reports to reference normalized IDs
   - Ensure backward compatibility with legacy data

5. **Documentation and Maintenance Plan**:
   - Document the normalization rules and processes
   - Create guidelines for adding new courses and players
   - Establish a maintenance schedule for keeping the system updated

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test course name normalization with a variety of inputs (misspellings, abbreviations, etc.)
   - Verify player matching algorithms with edge cases (similar names, name changes)
   - Validate data quality checks with both valid and invalid test data

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify that normalized data flows correctly through the entire system
   - Test integration with existing data pipelines and applications
   - Ensure that historical data is properly mapped to new normalized IDs

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Create a test suite with known course and player variations
   - Compare normalization results against expected outcomes
   - Measure match confidence scores and verify thresholds

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Benchmark normalization operations under load
   - Test system performance with large datasets
   - Verify caching mechanisms and query optimization

5. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Have data analysts verify normalized course and player information
   - Test manual override and correction workflows
   - Validate reporting and monitoring tools

6. **Regression Testing**:
   - Ensure that existing functionality continues to work with normalized data
   - Verify that historical analysis produces consistent results
