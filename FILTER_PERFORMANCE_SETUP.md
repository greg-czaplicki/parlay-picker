# 🏌️ Filter Performance Tracking Setup Guide

## ✅ What We've Built

Your filter performance tracking system is now complete! Here's what you have:

### 🗄️ **Database Layer**
- **New tables** for tracking matchup results and filter performance
- **Automated analysis** of filter effectiveness over time
- **Historical performance** data with confidence scores

### 🔄 **Automation System**
- **Vercel Cron** runs every 4 hours to check for completed rounds
- **Automatic result ingestion** when rounds finish
- **Filter performance analysis** runs automatically after results are processed

### 🎨 **User Interface**
- **Filter Performance Dashboard** - comprehensive analytics
- **Filter Confidence Indicators** - real-time confidence on filter buttons
- **Admin Dashboard** - manual control over all systems

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### 1. **Database Migration** (REQUIRED)
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of:
-- /supabase/migrations/002_create_filter_performance_tables.sql
```

This creates 4 new tables:
- `matchup_results` - Stores actual matchup outcomes
- `filter_performance_snapshots` - Filter performance per round
- `filter_historical_performance` - Aggregated performance data
- `filter_performance_events` - Significant performance events

### 2. **Environment Variables** (REQUIRED)
Add to your Vercel environment variables:

```bash
CRON_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

Generate a random secret key for cron authentication.

### 3. **Deploy to Vercel** (REQUIRED)
The system includes:
- ✅ Updated `vercel.json` with new cron job
- ✅ All API endpoints for automation
- ✅ Admin dashboard for manual control

After deployment, Vercel will automatically:
- Run the filter performance cron every 4 hours
- Check for completed tournament rounds
- Process results and update filter performance

### 4. **Test the System** (RECOMMENDED)
After deployment:

1. **Visit Admin Dashboard**: Go to your app → Admin tab
2. **Test Manual Run**: Click "Run Filter Analysis" to test the system
3. **Check Database**: Verify new tables were created in Supabase
4. **Monitor Cron**: Check Vercel dashboard for cron execution logs

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Automatic Flow:**
1. **Every 4 hours**: Vercel cron runs `/api/cron/check-rounds`
2. **Round Detection**: System checks for completed tournament rounds
3. **Result Ingestion**: Automatically processes matchup results
4. **Performance Analysis**: Calculates filter effectiveness
5. **Database Update**: Stores performance metrics and confidence scores
6. **UI Update**: Dashboard and filter buttons show updated data

### **Manual Controls:**
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full control over the system
- **Database Maintenance**: Run cleanup tasks manually
- **Pipeline Control**: Start/stop/run analysis on demand

## 📊 What You'll See

### **Filter Confidence Indicators**
Each filter preset button now shows:
- **Confidence Score**: How reliable the filter is (0-100%)
- **Edge Detection**: Whether the filter finds real betting edges
- **Trend Direction**: Improving, declining, or stable performance
- **Sample Size**: Amount of data backing the confidence

### **Performance Dashboard**
Complete analytics including:
- **Win Rate Comparison**: Actual vs expected performance
- **ROI Analysis**: Return on investment for each filter
- **Historical Trends**: Performance over time
- **Sample Size Distribution**: Data quality indicators

### **Admin Controls**
- **Pipeline Status**: Monitor automation system
- **Manual Triggers**: Run analysis or maintenance on demand
- **System Health**: Database and automation status

## 🔧 Configuration Options

The system is pre-configured with sensible defaults:

- **Cron Schedule**: Every 4 hours (`0 */4 * * *`)
- **Round Completion**: 80% of players must finish
- **Data Retention**: Historical analysis for filter confidence
- **Automation**: Fully automated processing

You can adjust these in the Admin Dashboard or API calls.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **If the system isn't working:**

1. **Check Database**: Make sure migration was run successfully
2. **Check Environment**: Verify `CRON_SECRET` is set in Vercel
3. **Check Logs**: View Vercel function logs for errors
4. **Test Manual**: Use Admin Dashboard to run analysis manually

### **If filters show "No Data":**
- The system needs completed tournament rounds to analyze
- Run a manual analysis in the Admin Dashboard
- Check that matchup data is available in your database

### **If cron isn't running:**
- Verify Vercel cron is enabled in your project settings  
- Check that `CRON_SECRET` environment variable is set
- Monitor Vercel dashboard for cron execution logs

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Once deployed and the database migration is run, your filter performance tracking system will:

- ✅ **Automatically track** all filter performance
- ✅ **Show confidence scores** on filter buttons  
- ✅ **Provide detailed analytics** in the dashboard
- ✅ **Update continuously** as new data comes in
- ✅ **Help you make** data-driven betting decisions

The system replaces your weekly maintenance cron with the filter performance cron, and you can now run maintenance tasks manually from the Admin Dashboard whenever needed.

**Happy analyzing!** 🏌️‍♂️📊
