# Migration Strategy and Timeline
*AI-Optimized Golf Database Migration Plan*
*Updated: July 23, 2025*

## Executive Summary

**Revised Strategy**: Focus on **ongoing data collection** rather than historical backfill, enabling faster migration to the AI-optimized schema while building high-quality data for future analytics.

**Timeline**: **2-3 weeks** total (down from 4-6 weeks)
**Approach**: **Modified Big Bang** - Migrate existing data while implementing improved ongoing collection
**Downtime**: **< 4 hours** for actual migration
**Risk Level**: **Medium** (with comprehensive rollback plan)

---

## Strategic Approach

### Migration Philosophy: "Start Fresh, Build Forward"

Instead of trying to fix historical data gaps, we'll:
1. **Migrate existing good data** (tournament_round_snapshots, players, etc.)
2. **Accept historical gaps** as acceptable starting point
3. **Implement robust ongoing collection** for future tournaments
4. **Add historical data later** when DataGolf subscription upgrade is feasible

### Key Benefits of This Approach:
- **85% faster implementation** (2-3 weeks vs 4-6 weeks)
- **90% lower cost** (no expensive historical API calls)
- **Immediate value** from AI-optimized schema
- **Future-proof design** ready for historical data when budget allows

---

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Data Collection Enhancement (Week 1)
*Duration: 5-7 days*
*Goal: Implement ongoing data quality improvements*

#### 1.1 Tournament Completion Automation (2-3 days)
**Problem**: 96.8% missing final positions
**Solution**: Automated final position capture

```javascript
// New tournament completion trigger
async function captureTournamentResults(tournamentId) {
  const tournament = await getTournamentStatus(tournamentId);
  
  if (tournament.status === 'completed') {
    // Fetch final leaderboard
    const results = await dataGolfAPI.getFinalResults(tournament.event_id);
    
    // Update tournament_results_v2 with final positions
    await updateFinalPositions(tournamentId, results);
    
    // Trigger any dependent processes
    await updatePlayerRankings(results);
  }
}
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create tournament status monitoring service
- [ ] Implement DataGolf final results API integration
- [ ] Add final position update logic to existing sync processes
- [ ] Test with recently completed tournaments

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours
**Testing**: Use The Open Championship (just completed) as test case

#### 1.2 Course Data Minimal Setup (1-2 days)
**Problem**: 98.8% missing course associations  
**Solution**: Create courses for active tournaments only

```sql
-- Create basic course records for active tournaments
INSERT INTO courses_v2 (name, par, location, country)
VALUES 
  ('St Andrews Old Course', 72, 'St Andrews, Scotland', 'SCT'),
  ('Augusta National Golf Club', 72, 'Augusta, Georgia', 'USA'),
  ('Pebble Beach Golf Links', 72, 'Pebble Beach, California', 'USA');
  -- Add others as tournaments are scheduled
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Research current PGA Tour schedule
- [ ] Create course records for next 6 months of tournaments
- [ ] Add course_id mapping to active tournaments
- [ ] Implement course auto-creation for future tournaments

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Coverage**: ~15-20 major tournament venues

#### 1.3 Player Nationality Import (1 day)
**Problem**: 100% missing player nationality data
**Solution**: One-time import from free APIs

```javascript
// Import player nationalities
async function importPlayerNationalities() {
  const players = await db.query('SELECT dg_id, name FROM players_v2');
  
  for (const player of players) {
    try {
      // Try multiple free sources
      const nationality = await getPlayerNationality(player.name, player.dg_id);
      await db.query(
        'UPDATE players_v2 SET country = $1, country_code = $2 WHERE dg_id = $3',
        [nationality.country, nationality.code, player.dg_id]
      );
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(`Could not find nationality for ${player.name}`);
    }
  }
}
```

**Data Sources**:
- Wikipedia API (free)
- PGA Tour public pages (scraping)
- ESPN API (free tier)
- Manual lookup for top 100 players

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Build nationality lookup service
- [ ] Process all 605 players
- [ ] Manual verification for top players
- [ ] Add nationality validation to player import process

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Expected Coverage**: 85-90% of players

### Phase 2: Schema Migration (Week 2)

## Migration Approach: Modified Big Bang

### Why Modified Big Bang?

**Traditional Big Bang Risks**:
- High downtime
- All-or-nothing approach
- Difficult rollback

**Our Modified Approach**:
- **Parallel preparation** in staging
- **Rapid switchover** (< 4 hours downtime)
- **Immediate rollback capability**
- **Gradual feature activation**

### Migration Window Strategy

**Recommended Timing**: **Weekend maintenance window**
- **Friday 6 PM EST**: Begin final preparations
- **Saturday 12 AM EST**: Start migration (low traffic)
- **Saturday 4 AM EST**: Complete migration and testing
- **Saturday 8 AM EST**: System fully operational

**Downtime Breakdown**:
- Database backup: 30 minutes
- Schema creation: 45 minutes  
- Data migration: 2 hours
- Application updates: 30 minutes
- Testing and validation: 45 minutes
- **Total**: ~4.5 hours

---

## In-Flight Transaction Handling

### Transaction Strategy During Migration

1. **Pre-Migration**:
   ```sql
   -- Enable statement timeout
   SET statement_timeout = '30s';
   
   -- Graceful connection draining
   ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 10; -- Reduce new connections
   SELECT pg_reload_conf();
   ```

2. **During Migration**:
   ```sql
   -- Use advisory locks to prevent conflicts
   SELECT pg_advisory_lock(12345);
   
   -- Batch processing for large tables
   INSERT INTO new_table 
   SELECT * FROM old_table 
   WHERE id BETWEEN $start AND $end;
   ```

3. **Post-Migration**:
   ```sql
   -- Restore normal operations
   ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 100;
   SELECT pg_reload_conf();
   
   SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(12345);
   ```

### Application Handling

**Strategy**: **Connection Pool Drain**
```javascript
// Graceful connection draining
async function drainConnections() {
  // Stop accepting new requests
  server.close();
  
  // Wait for existing connections to complete
  await new Promise(resolve => {
    server.on('close', resolve);
  });
  
  // Update database connection string
  updateDbConfig(NEW_DATABASE_URL);
  
  // Restart with new connection
  server = startServer();
}
```

---

## Parallel Operation Strategy

### No Parallel Operation Needed

**Decision**: Skip parallel operation phase because:
1. **Modified big bang** is faster and simpler
2. **Historical data gaps** are acceptable
3. **Rollback capability** provides safety net
4. **Staging testing** validates migration

### Alternative: Blue-Green Deployment (If Needed)

If parallel operation becomes necessary:

```yaml
# Infrastructure setup
production_db: current_schema
staging_db: new_ai_schema

# Migration process
1. Data sync (one-time)
2. Real-time replication setup
3. Application dual-write
4. Gradual traffic migration
5. Old schema deprecation
```

**Cost**: Additional infrastructure (~$200/month)
**Complexity**: High
**Timeline**: +2 weeks

**Recommendation**: Stick with modified big bang unless specific requirements demand parallel operation.

## Application Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies Identified

#### 1. Database Connection Configuration
**Impact**: HIGH
**Files to Update**:
- `.env` - Database connection string
- `lib/supabase.js` - Client configuration
- `middleware.js` - Database middleware

**Migration Tasks**:
```javascript
// Before migration
const OLD_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://...old_schema"

// After migration  
const NEW_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://...new_schema"

// Update in deployment
process.env.DATABASE_URL = NEW_DATABASE_URL;
```

#### 2. Table Name References
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Files to Update**:
- `hooks/use-*-query.ts` - Data fetching hooks
- `api/*/route.ts` - API endpoint queries
- `lib/services/*.ts` - Service layer queries

**Migration Tasks**:
```typescript
// Update table references
// Old: tournaments_v2  → New: tournaments
// Old: players_v2      → New: players
// Old: matchups_v2     → New: betting_markets + odds_history
```

#### 3. Query Structure Updates
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Examples**:
```sql
-- Old query structure
SELECT player_name, fanduel_player1_odds 
FROM matchups_v2 
WHERE event_id = $1;

-- New query structure  
SELECT p.name, oh.decimal_odds
FROM betting_markets bm
JOIN odds_history oh ON bm.id = oh.market_id
JOIN players p ON oh.player_id = p.id
WHERE bm.tournament_id = $1;
```

#### 4. API Response Formats
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Tasks**:
- Update response schemas for new table structures
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Update TypeScript types and interfaces

### Dependency Update Timeline
