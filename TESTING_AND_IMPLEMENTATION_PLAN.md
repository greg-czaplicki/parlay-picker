    CASE WHEN COUNT(*) >= 4 THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL' END as result
FROM pg_extension 
WHERE extname IN ('uuid-ossp', 'timescaledb', 'vector', 'pg_stat_statements');

-- Expected result: All 4 extensions present (PASS)
```

**Test Case: TC-SCHEMA-003 - Constraint Validation**
```sql

    'Constraints Test' as test_name,
    COUNT(*) as foreign_keys_created,
    CASE WHEN COUNT(*) >= 15 THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL' END as result
FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
AND table_schema = 'public';

-- Expected result: 15+ foreign keys (PASS)
```

### 1.2 Data Migration Testing

**Test Case: TC-DATA-001 - Player Migration Accuracy**
```sql
-- Test objective: Verify player data migration accuracy
WITH migration_comparison AS (
    SELECT 
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players_v2) as source_count,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players) as target_count,
        (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM players_v2) as source_unique,
        (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM players) as target_unique
)
SELECT 
    'Player Migration Test' as test_name,
    source_count,
    target_count,
    ROUND((target_count::FLOAT / source_count) * 100, 2) as preservation_rate,
    CASE 
        WHEN target_count >= source_count * 0.85 THEN 'PASS'
        ELSE 'FAIL'
    END as result
FROM migration_comparison;

-- Expected result: >85% preservation rate (PASS)
```

**Test Case: TC-DATA-002 - Tournament Data Integrity**
```sql
-- Test objective: Verify tournament migration with enhanced data
WITH tournament_analysis AS (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as migrated_tournaments,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN course_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as tournaments_with_courses,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN purse > 0 THEN 1 END) as tournaments_with_purse,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN field_size > 0 THEN 1 END) as tournaments_with_field_size
    FROM tournaments
)
SELECT 
    'Tournament Migration Test' as test_name,
    migrated_tournaments,
    ROUND((tournaments_with_courses::FLOAT / migrated_tournaments) * 100, 2) as course_link_rate,
    CASE 
        WHEN tournaments_with_courses >= migrated_tournaments * 0.7 THEN 'PASS'
        ELSE 'FAIL'
    END as result
FROM tournament_analysis;

-- Expected result: >70% tournaments linked to courses (PASS)
```

**Test Case: TC-DATA-003 - Performance Data Migration**
```sql
-- Test objective: Verify performance data preservation
SELECT 
    'Performance Data Test' as test_name,
    COUNT(*) as performance_records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) as unique_players,
    COUNT(DISTINCT tournament_id) as unique_tournaments,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) > 10000 AND COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) > 100 
        THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL'
    END as result
FROM player_tournament_performance;

-- Expected result: >10k records, >100 players (PASS)
```

### 1.3 Rollback Testing

**Test Case: TC-ROLLBACK-001 - Complete Rollback**
```sql
-- Test objective: Verify rollback restores original state
-- Execution: Run migration, then rollback, then validate

-- Pre-rollback snapshot
CREATE TEMP TABLE pre_rollback_state AS
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_live_tup as record_count
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- After rollback validation
SELECT 
    'Rollback Test' as test_name,
    COUNT(*) as original_tables_restored,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pre_rollback_state)
        THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL'
    END as result
FROM pg_stat_user_tables p
JOIN pre_rollback_state pre ON pre.tablename = p.tablename
WHERE p.schemaname = 'public'
AND p.n_live_tup = pre.record_count;

-- Expected result: All original tables restored (PASS)
```

## Phase 2: Integration Testing

### 2.1 End-to-End Migration Process

**Test Scenario: Full Migration Workflow**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test script: full_migration_test.sh

set -e

echo "Starting full migration integration test..."

# Step 1: Create baseline snapshot
psql -d test_golf_db -c "
CREATE TABLE baseline_snapshot AS 
SELECT 
    'players_v2' as table_name, 
    COUNT(*) as record_count 
FROM players_v2
UNION ALL
SELECT 'tournaments_v2', COUNT(*) FROM tournaments_v2
UNION ALL
SELECT 'matchups_v2', COUNT(*) FROM matchups_v2;"

# Step 2: Execute full migration
echo "Executing schema creation..."
psql -d test_golf_db -f 01-create-new-schema.sql

echo "Executing data migration..."
psql -d test_golf_db -f 02-data-migration-etl.sql

echo "Executing validation..."
psql -d test_golf_db -f 03-validation-and-verification.sql

# Step 3: Validate migration success
VALIDATION_SCORE=$(psql -d test_golf_db -t -c "
SELECT COALESCE(AVG(
    CASE WHEN validation_result = 'PASS' THEN 100.0 ELSE 0.0 END
), 0)
FROM migration_validation_results;")

echo "Migration validation score: $VALIDATION_SCORE%"

if (( $(echo "$VALIDATION_SCORE >= 90" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "✅ Integration test PASSED"
    exit 0
else
    echo "❌ Integration test FAILED"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Expected Results:**
- All migration scripts execute without errors
- Validation score ≥90%
- No critical validation failures
- Data preservation rate ≥85%

### 2.2 Application Integration Testing

**Test Case: API Endpoint Validation**
```javascript
// Test script: api_integration_test.js
const axios = require('axios');

const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:3000/api';

async function testPlayerEndpoints() {
    console.log('Testing player endpoints...');
    
    // Test player list
    const playersResponse = await axios.get(`${API_BASE}/players`);
    console.assert(playersResponse.status === 200, 'Players endpoint failed');
    console.assert(playersResponse.data.length > 0, 'No players returned');
    
    // Test player details
    const playerId = playersResponse.data[0].id;
    const playerResponse = await axios.get(`${API_BASE}/players/${playerId}`);
    console.assert(playerResponse.status === 200, 'Player details failed');
    
    console.log('✅ Player endpoints working');
}

async function testTournamentEndpoints() {
    console.log('Testing tournament endpoints...');
    
    // Test tournament list
    const tournamentsResponse = await axios.get(`${API_BASE}/tournaments`);
    console.assert(tournamentsResponse.status === 200, 'Tournaments endpoint failed');
    console.assert(tournamentsResponse.data.length > 0, 'No tournaments returned');
    
    // Test tournament details with performance data
    const tournamentId = tournamentsResponse.data[0].id;
    const tournamentResponse = await axios.get(`${API_BASE}/tournaments/${tournamentId}`);
    console.assert(tournamentResponse.status === 200, 'Tournament details failed');
    
    console.log('✅ Tournament endpoints working');
}

async function testBettingEndpoints() {
    console.log('Testing betting endpoints...');
    
    // Test betting markets
    const marketsResponse = await axios.get(`${API_BASE}/betting-markets`);
    console.assert(marketsResponse.status === 200, 'Betting markets failed');
    
    // Test odds data
    const oddsResponse = await axios.get(`${API_BASE}/odds/current`);
    console.assert(oddsResponse.status === 200, 'Current odds failed');
    
    console.log('✅ Betting endpoints working');
}

// Execute all tests
(async () => {
    try {
        await testPlayerEndpoints();
        await testTournamentEndpoints();
        await testBettingEndpoints();
        console.log('🎉 All API integration tests passed!');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('❌ API integration test failed:', error.message);
        process.exit(1);
    }
})();
```

LEFT JOIN player_tournament_performance ptp ON p.id = ptp.player_id
WHERE p.name ILIKE 'Tiger Woods'
LIMIT 10;

-- Performance Test 2: Tournament leaderboard (should be <200ms)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    p.name,
    ptp.total_score,
    ptp.position,
    ptp.prize_money
FROM player_tournament_performance ptp
JOIN players p ON ptp.player_id = p.id
WHERE ptp.tournament_id = (SELECT id FROM tournaments ORDER BY start_date DESC LIMIT 1)
ORDER BY ptp.position
LIMIT 50;

-- Performance Test 3: Betting odds query (should be <100ms)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    p.name,
    bm.market_type,
    oh.odds_decimal,
    oh.recorded_at
FROM odds_history oh
JOIN betting_markets bm ON oh.market_id = bm.id
JOIN players p ON bm.player_id = p.id

measure_query() {
    local query="$1"
    local description="$2"
    local max_time_ms="$3"
    
    echo "Testing: $description"
    
    local start_time=$(date +%s%3N)
    psql -d golf_parlay_db -c "$query" > /dev/null
    local end_time=$(date +%s%3N)
    
    local duration=$((end_time - start_time))
    
    if [ $duration -le $max_time_ms ]; then
        echo "✅ $description: ${duration}ms (target: <${max_time_ms}ms)"
    else
        echo "❌ $description: ${duration}ms (target: <${max_time_ms}ms) - TOO SLOW"
        return 1
    fi
}

# Core performance tests
measure_query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players;" "Player count query" 50
measure_query "SELECT * FROM tournaments ORDER BY start_date DESC LIMIT 20;" "Recent tournaments" 100

        WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players) > 100 
         AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tournaments) > 10
         AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM player_tournament_performance) > 1000
        THEN 'PASS'
        ELSE 'FAIL'
    END as status;"

# Application health
curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health || echo "❌ Application health check failed"

echo "Immediate validation complete"
```

#### Hours 2-6: Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query response times
- Check database connection pools
- Validate memory and CPU usage
- Review application logs for errors

#### Hours 6-24: User Experience Validation
- Test critical user workflows
- Monitor error rates and user feedback
- Validate data accuracy in UI
- Check betting odds and market updates

### Short-term Monitoring (1-7 days)

#### Daily Health Checks
```sql
-- Daily migration health report
WITH daily_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        'Migration Health Report - ' || CURRENT_DATE as report_title,
        
        -- Data freshness
        (SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM tournaments) as latest_tournament,
        (SELECT MAX(updated_at) FROM player_tournament_performance) as latest_performance,
        
        -- System performance
        (SELECT AVG(total_exec_time/calls) FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE calls > 100) as avg_query_time,
        
        -- Data growth
        pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database())) as database_size,
        
        -- Error indicators
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM migration_log WHERE status = 'ERROR' AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE) as daily_errors
)
SELECT * FROM daily_stats;
```

#### Weekly Optimization Review
- Identify slow queries for optimization
- Review index usage and effectiveness
- Monitor storage growth patterns
- Plan capacity adjustments if needed

### Long-term Success Metrics (1-4 weeks)

#### Performance Benchmarking
```sql
-- 30-day performance comparison
WITH performance_baseline AS (
    SELECT 
        query,
        mean_exec_time as baseline_time,
        calls as baseline_calls
    FROM pg_stat_statements_baseline -- Pre-migration snapshot
),
current_performance AS (
    SELECT 
        query,
        mean_exec_time as current_time,
        calls as current_calls
    FROM pg_stat_statements
    WHERE calls > 10
)
SELECT 
    p.query,
    p.baseline_time,
    c.current_time,
    ROUND(((c.current_time - p.baseline_time) / p.baseline_time) * 100, 2) as percent_change,
    CASE 
        WHEN c.current_time < p.baseline_time THEN '✅ IMPROVED'
        WHEN c.current_time <= p.baseline_time * 1.1 THEN '✅ MAINTAINED'
        ELSE '⚠️ DEGRADED'
    END as performance_status
FROM performance_baseline p
JOIN current_performance c ON p.query = c.query
ORDER BY percent_change DESC;
```
