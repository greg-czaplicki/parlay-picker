## Critical Data Quality Issues

### 1. Tournament Results Data (🔥 CRITICAL)

**Issues Identified:**
- **753/778 records (96.8%)** missing final_position
- **424 records** marked as made_cut=true but no final position
- **231 records** with inconsistent round scores vs rounds_completed
- **3 records** with unrealistic scores (outside 50-100 range)

**Impact:** Tournament results are effectively unusable for analysis or betting decisions.

**SQL Validation Query:**
```sql
-- Validate tournament results issues
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN final_position IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_position,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN made_cut = true AND final_position IS NULL THEN 1 END) as cut_but_no_position,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN rounds_completed > 0 AND 
        ((rounds_completed >= 1 AND round_1_score IS NULL) OR
         (rounds_completed >= 2 AND round_2_score IS NULL) OR
         (rounds_completed >= 3 AND round_3_score IS NULL) OR
         (rounds_completed >= 4 AND round_4_score IS NULL)) THEN 1 END) as inconsistent_scores
FROM tournament_results_v2;
```

### 2. Player Data Completeness (🔥 CRITICAL)

**Issues Identified:**
- **605/605 players (100%)** missing country information
- **605/605 players (100%)** missing country_code information
- **1 duplicate player name** detected: "La Sasso, Michael" (IDs: 30036168, 33755)
- **161 players (26.6%)** never updated since creation

**Impact:** Cannot perform nationality-based analysis or player demographics.

**SQL Validation Query:**
```sql
-- Validate player data completeness
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_players,
    COUNT(country) as has_country,
    COUNT(country_code) as has_country_code,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) = DATE_TRUNC('day', updated_at) THEN 1 END) as never_updated
FROM players_v2;

-- Find duplicate names
SELECT name, COUNT(*), array_agg(dg_id) as dg_ids
FROM players_v2 
GROUP BY name 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 3. Matchups Data Quality (⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issues Identified:**
- **7,736/10,539 matchups (73.4%)** missing FanDuel odds data
- **3,263/10,539 matchups (31.0%)** missing tee time information
- **56 matchups** have player name mismatches with players_v2 table
- All DraftKings odds present (good data source)

**Impact:** Limited betting analysis capability due to missing odds.

**SQL Validation Query:**
```sql
-- Validate matchups data quality
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_matchups,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN odds1 IS NULL AND odds2 IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_fanduel_odds,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN dg_odds1 IS NULL AND dg_odds2 IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_dk_odds,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN tee_time IS NULL AND player1_tee_time IS NULL AND player2_tee_time IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_tee_times
FROM matchups_v2;

-- Check name mismatches
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM matchups_v2 m
JOIN players_v2 p1 ON m.player1_dg_id = p1.dg_id
WHERE TRIM(LOWER(m.player1_name)) != TRIM(LOWER(p1.name));
```

### 4. Course Data Catastrophe (🔥 CRITICAL)

**Issues Identified:**
- **Only 3 courses remain** in courses_v2 table (12 created, 8 deleted)
- **80/81 tournaments (98.8%)** have no course linkage
- Massive data loss indicates potential bulk deletion or migration failure

**Impact:** Cannot perform course-specific analysis or difficulty adjustments.

**SQL Validation Query:**
```sql
-- Validate course data issues
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM courses_v2) as remaining_courses,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tournaments_v2 t 
     LEFT JOIN courses_v2 c ON TRIM(LOWER(t.course_name)) = TRIM(LOWER(c.course_name))
     WHERE c.course_id IS NULL AND t.course_name IS NOT NULL) as unlinked_tournaments;
```

### 5. Tournament Status Inconsistencies (⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issues Identified:**
- **25 tournaments** marked as completed but have future start dates
- No past tournaments marked as upcoming (good)
- Tournament status management needs review

**SQL Validation Query:**
```sql
-- Validate tournament status consistency
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN start_date > CURRENT_DATE AND status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as future_completed,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN end_date < CURRENT_DATE AND status = 'upcoming' THEN 1 END) as past_upcoming
FROM tournaments_v2;
```

## Empty and Problematic Tables

### Completely Empty Tables
- **hole_statistics** (0 records, 128 KB) - Table structure exists but no data
- **player_advanced_stats_v2** (0 records, 168 KB) - Advanced metrics missing
- **bet_snapshots** (0 records, 24 KB) - Betting tracking not operational

### High Churn Tables
- **player_season_stats** (176 records remaining, 2,479 deleted) - 93% deletion ratio
- **settlement_history** (132 records remaining, 116 deleted) - 47% deletion ratio

## Referential Integrity Analysis

✅ **Good News:** No orphaned foreign key relationships detected between:
- matchups_v2 → players_v2 (all player references valid)
- tournament_results_v2 → tournaments_v2 (all tournament references valid)
- matchups_v2 → tournaments_v2 (all event references valid)

## Data Cleansing Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical Priority)

1. **Tournament Results Recovery**
   ```sql
   -- Identify tournaments needing result backfill
   SELECT DISTINCT t.event_name, t.event_id, t.status, t.end_date
   FROM tournaments_v2 t
   JOIN tournament_results_v2 tr ON t.event_id = tr.event_id
   WHERE tr.final_position IS NULL
   ORDER BY t.end_date DESC;
   ```

2. **Player Data Enhancement**
   ```sql
   -- Create player data update template
   UPDATE players_v2 
   SET country = 'USA', country_code = 'US', updated_at = NOW()
   WHERE dg_id IN (
     -- List of confirmed US players
   );
   ```

3. **Course Data Restoration**
   ```sql
   -- Rebuild courses from tournament data
   INSERT INTO courses_v2 (course_name, location, country, par, yardage)
   SELECT DISTINCT 
     course_name,
     'TBD' as location,
     'USA' as country, 
     COALESCE(course_par, 72) as par,
     7200 as yardage  -- Default estimate
   FROM tournaments_v2 
   WHERE course_name IS NOT NULL
   AND course_name NOT IN (SELECT course_name FROM courses_v2);
   ```

### Secondary Actions (High Priority)

4. **Matchups Odds Backfill**
   - Implement FanDuel API integration
   - Historical odds recovery from archived data
   - Establish real-time odds monitoring

5. **Player Name Standardization**
   ```sql
   -- Resolve duplicate player names
   UPDATE matchups_v2 SET player1_name = p.name
   FROM players_v2 p 
   WHERE matchups_v2.player1_dg_id = p.dg_id
   AND TRIM(LOWER(matchups_v2.player1_name)) != TRIM(LOWER(p.name));
   ```

### Ongoing Maintenance (Medium Priority)

6. **Data Validation Triggers**
   ```sql
   -- Create data quality monitoring
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_tournament_result()
   RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
   BEGIN
     IF NEW.made_cut = true AND NEW.final_position IS NULL THEN
       RAISE WARNING 'Player made cut but no final position provided';
     END IF;
     RETURN NEW;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```

7. **Empty Table Cleanup**
   ```sql
   -- Remove empty tables or implement data population
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hole_statistics;  -- If not needed
   -- OR implement hole-by-hole data collection
   ```

## Migration Readiness Assessment

### Ready for Migration ✅
- tournament_round_snapshots
- player_round_changes  
- historical_player_skill_ratings
- live_tournament_stats

### Requires Cleansing Before Migration ⚠️
- matchups_v2 (odds backfill needed)
- tournaments_v2 (status cleanup needed)
- players_v2 (nationality data needed)

### Critical Blockers 🔥
- **tournament_results_v2** - 97% missing data
- **courses_v2** - 98% data loss
- **Empty tables** - No data to migrate

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Data Recovery Costs (Estimated)
- **Tournament results backfill:** 40-60 hours (external API calls)
- **Player nationality data:** 8-12 hours (manual research + API)
- **Course data reconstruction:** 20-30 hours (research + validation)
- **Odds data recovery:** 60-80 hours (multiple API integrations)

### Business Impact
- **Without fixes:** Limited analysis capability, unreliable betting recommendations
- **With fixes:** Full historical analysis, accurate predictions, comprehensive reporting

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week):**
   - Execute player name standardization fixes
   - Implement data validation triggers
   - Begin tournament results backfill for recent events

2. **Short Term (2-4 Weeks):**
   - Complete course data reconstruction
   - Implement FanDuel odds integration
   - Populate player nationality data

3. **Long Term (1-2 Months):**
   - Historical odds recovery
   - Advanced analytics table population
   - Implement real-time data quality monitoring

## Conclusion

The database requires **substantial data cleansing** before production readiness. Focus on tournament results and course data as critical blockers, followed by odds integration for complete functionality. The underlying data structure is sound, but content completeness is severely lacking.

**Recommendation:** Delay migration until tournament results and course data issues are resolved (minimum 4-6 weeks of intensive data recovery work).
